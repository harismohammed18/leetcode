# Intuition

When a function is called multiple times with the same arguments, and its output does not change (i.e., itâ€™s **pure**), we can cache the results to avoid recomputation. This technique is called **memoization**.

Memoization is especially useful for expensive or recursive computations, like Fibonacci numbers, dynamic programming problems, or data-intensive operations.

# Approach

We define a `memoize` function that takes any function `fn` and returns a new function with caching behavior.

Internally:
- We use a **nested `Map` structure** to handle caching for functions with multiple arguments.
- Each argument is used to traverse or create levels in the nested map.
- The final level holds the actual computed result using a special key `__result__`.
- If the same arguments are passed again, we return the cached result directly instead of recomputing.

Additionally:
- We track how many times the original function `fn` was actually executed (not retrieved from cache) using a `callCount` variable.
- This count is attached to the memoized function as `.calls`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  - Worst-case (no cache hits): $$O(n)$$ per call to `fn`, where \( n \) is the cost of executing `fn`.
  - Average-case with memoization: amortized cost is much lower for repeated calls due to cache retrieval in $$O(1)$$ time for each argument level.

- Space complexity: $$O(k^d)$$  
  - Where \( d \) is the number of arguments (`args.length`) and \( k \) is the number of distinct values passed to each argument. The nested `Map` can grow with unique argument combinations.

# Code
```typescript []
function memoize(fn: (...args: any[]) => any): (...args: any[]) => any {
  const cache = new Map<any, any>();
  let callCount = 0;

  function memoized(...args: any[]) {
    let current = cache;

    for (const arg of args) {
      if (!current.has(arg)) {
        current.set(arg, new Map());
      }
      current = current.get(arg);
    }

    if (!current.has('__result__')) {
      const result = fn(...args);
      current.set('__result__', result);
      callCount++;
    }

    // This log structure is just for your output format:
    (memoized as any).calls = callCount;
    return current.get('__result__');
  }

  (memoized as any).calls = callCount;
  return memoized;
}
