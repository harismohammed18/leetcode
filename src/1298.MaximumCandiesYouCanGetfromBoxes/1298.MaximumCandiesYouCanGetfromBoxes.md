# Intuition
We are given a set of boxes, each of which may be:
- Already open or closed,
- Contain candies we want to collect,
- Contain keys to other boxes,
- Contain other unopened boxes.

The key idea is to simulate the process of collecting candies by opening as many accessible boxes as possible. This is similar to a graph traversal problem where each box can unlock access to new nodes (boxes) via keys or containedBoxes.

We need to:
- Track which boxes we currently own (`haveBox`)
- Track which boxes we can open (`canOpen`)
- Track which boxes we have already opened (`visited`)

# Approach
We use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach via a queue:
1. Start with the `initialBoxes` — mark them as "haveBox".
2. Enqueue any boxes that are already open.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Open the box and mark it as visited.
   - Collect candies.
   - For each key inside, mark the corresponding box as "canOpen" and enqueue it if we already have it.
   - For each contained box, mark it as "haveBox" and enqueue it if we can already open it.

We continue this process until no more boxes can be opened.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(N + K + C)$$  
  Where:
  - \( N \) is the number of boxes,
  - \( K \) is the total number of keys across all boxes,
  - \( C \) is the total number of contained boxes.  
  Each box, key, and contained box is processed at most once.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(N)$$  
  For:
  - Tracking visited status,
  - Storing whether we have a box,
  - Checking if we can open a box,
  - The queue used for BFS traversal.

# Code
```typescript []
function maxCandies(
  status: number[],
  candies: number[],
  keys: number[][],
  containedBoxes: number[][],
  initialBoxes: number[]
): number {
  const n = status.length;
  const haveBox = new Set<number>(initialBoxes);
  const canOpen = new Set<number>();
  const visited = new Set<number>();

  const queue: number[] = [];

  // Add initially open boxes to queue
  for (const box of initialBoxes) {
    if (status[box] === 1) {
      queue.push(box);
    }
  }

  let totalCandies = 0;

  while (queue.length) {
    const box = queue.pop()!;
    if (visited.has(box)) continue;

    visited.add(box);
    totalCandies += candies[box];

    // Add keys we gain from current box
    for (const key of keys[box]) {
      if (!canOpen.has(key)) {
        canOpen.add(key);
        // If we already have the box and haven't visited it, enqueue it
        if (haveBox.has(key) && !visited.has(key)) {
          queue.push(key);
        }
      }
    }

    // Add contained boxes
    for (const contained of containedBoxes[box]) {
      if (!haveBox.has(contained)) haveBox.add(contained);
      // If it’s open or we have a key, enqueue it
      if ((status[contained] === 1 || canOpen.has(contained)) && !visited.has(contained)) {
        queue.push(contained);
      }
    }
  }

  return totalCandies;
}
