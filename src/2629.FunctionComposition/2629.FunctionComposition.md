# Intuition

Function composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming. The idea is to **chain multiple functions together** such that the output of one function becomes the input of the next. For example, composing `f(g(x))` means `g` runs first, and `f` runs on its result.

In this problem, we are given a list of functions and want to return a new function that applies them from **right to left** â€” i.e., the last function in the array is applied first.

# Approach

We define a function `compose` that takes an array of functions `functions: F[]`, where each function takes a number and returns a number.

Inside the returned function, we use `Array.prototype.reduceRight` to apply the functions in reverse order:
- `reduceRight` starts from the end of the array.
- At each step, the current function is applied to the accumulated result (`acc`).

This way, `compose([f, g, h])(x)` computes `f(g(h(x)))`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$  
  Where \( n \) is the number of functions in the `functions` array. Each function is called once.

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$  
  We use a single accumulator and do not create additional data structures proportional to input size.

# Code
```typescript []
type F = (x: number) => number;

function compose(functions: F[]): F {
  return function (x: number) {
    return functions.reduceRight((acc, fn): number => fn(acc), x);
  };
}

/**
 * const fn = compose([x => x + 1, x => 2 * x])
 * fn(4) // 9
 */

```
