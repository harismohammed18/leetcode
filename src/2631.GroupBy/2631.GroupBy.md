# Intuition

In many data-processing scenarios, we often need to **group elements** of an array by some common key â€” such as grouping people by city, students by grade, or items by category. While JavaScript provides methods like `filter` and `reduce`, it lacks a built-in `groupBy`.

By extending `Array.prototype`, we make grouping more expressive and reusable across different parts of an application.

# Approach

We define a method `groupBy` on the `Array` prototype. It accepts a callback function `fn` that extracts a **grouping key** from each item in the array.

Internally:
- We declare `result` as an empty object `Record<K, T[]>`.
- We iterate through each item in the array.
- For each item, we use `fn(item)` to compute its group key.
- If the key doesn't exist in `result`, we initialize an empty array.
- Then we push the current item into the array for that key.

To support TypeScript properly, we:
- Use `declare global` to extend the `Array<T>` interface.
- Ensure type safety using generic constraints: `K extends string`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  Each item is visited exactly once.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(n)$$  
  All elements are stored in grouped buckets within a new object.

# Code
```typescript
export {};

declare global {
  interface Array<T> {
    groupBy<K extends string>(fn: (item: T) => K): Record<K, T[]>;
  }
}

Array.prototype.groupBy = function <T, K extends string>(
  this: T[],
  fn: (item: T) => K
): Record<K, T[]> {
  const result: Record<K, T[]> = {} as Record<K, T[]>;
  
  for (const item of this) {
    const key = fn(item);
    if (!result[key]) {
      result[key] = [];
    }
    result[key].push(item);
  }

  return result;
};
